In this notebook, some template code has already been provided for you, and you will need to implement additional functionality to successfully complete this project. You will not need to modify the included code beyond what is requested. Sections that begin with **'Implementation'** in the header indicate that the following block of code will require additional functionality which you must provide. Instructions will be provided for each section and the specifics of the implementation are marked in the code block with a 'TODO' statement. Please be sure to read the instructions carefully!\n",

Each section where you will answer a question is preceded by a **'Question X'** header.

    "## Getting Started\n",
    "In this project, you will evaluate the performance and predictive power of a model that has been trained and tested on data collected from homes in suburbs of Boston, Massachusetts. A model trained on this data that is seen as a *good fit* could then be used to make certain predictions about a home — in particular, its monetary value. This model would prove to be invaluable for someone like a real estate agent who could make use of such information on a daily basis.\n",

    "The dataset for this project originates from the [UCI Machine Learning Repository](https://archive.ics.uci.edu/ml/datasets/Housing). The Boston housing data was collected in 1978 and each of the 506 entries represent aggregated data about 14 features for homes from various suburbs in Boston, Massachusetts. For the purposes of this project, the following preprocessing steps have been made to the dataset:\n",
    "- 16 data points have an `'MEDV'` value of 50.0. These data points likely contain **missing or censored values** and have been removed.\n",
    "- 1 data point has an `'RM'` value of 8.78. This data point can be considered an **outlier** and has been removed.\n",
    "- The features `'RM'`, `'LSTAT'`, `'PTRATIO'`, and `'MEDV'` are essential. The remaining **non-relevant features** have been excluded.\n",
    "- The feature `'MEDV'` has been **multiplicatively scaled** to account for 35 years of market inflation.\n",

    "1) The appropriate model that can be chosen from the above models is with max_depth = 3 <br>\n",
    "2) The score of the training increases and that of testing decreases as more training points are added. <br>\n",
    "3) Having more training points nenefits the model in the sense that we get a converging learning curve for the model, i.e the scores for the training and testing datasets have approximately equal scores. However, after the certain benchmark thereshold is attained, more training points are not necesary as we the convergence has already been established and there are very less improvements in the score. e.g the model improves by 1-2% only."

    "The following code cell produces a graph for a decision tree model that has been trained and validated on the training data using different maximum depths. The graph produces two complexity curves — one for training and one for validation. Similar to the **learning curves**, the shaded regions of both the complexity curves denote the uncertainty in those curves, and the model is scored on both the training and validation sets using the `performance_metric` function.  \n",

    "* How about when the model is trained with a maximum depth of 10? What visual cues in the graph justify your conclusions?\n",
    "\n",
    "**Hint:** High bias is a sign of underfitting(model is not complex enough to pick up the nuances in the data) and high variance is a sign of overfitting(model is by-hearting the data and cannot generalize well). Think about which model(depth 1 or 10) aligns with which part of the tradeoff."

    "1) When the model is trained for the max_depth of 1, the model suffers from high bias. <br>\n",
    "2) When the model is trained upto a max_depth of 10, the model suffers from high variance. It can be concluded the same from the graph because at max_depth 10 the training scores are increasing while the validating scores are decreasing. This shows that the model now starts to memorize the training set than to actually \"learn\""

At what point do we get our best validation score without overcomplicating our model?

    "**Answer:** <br>\n",

    "We score each such model using a **scorer** and finally select the model parameters which gives us the best score. <br>\n",
    "Parameters taken by GridSearch : The estimator, the parameters to be tested (in a dict), a scorer (performance metric). <br>\n",

    "* What is the k-fold cross-validation training technique? \n",
    "\n",
    "* What benefit does this technique provide for grid search when optimizing a model?\n",
    "\n",
    "**Hint:** When explaining the k-fold cross validation technique, be sure to touch upon what 'k' is, how the dataset is split into different parts for training and testing and the number of times it is run based on the 'k' value.\n",
    "\n",
    "When thinking about how k-fold cross validation helps grid search, think about the main drawbacks of grid search which are hinged upon **using a particular subset of data for training or testing** and how k-fold cv could help alleviate that. You can refer to the [docs](http://scikit-learn.org/stable/modules/cross_validation.html#cross-validation) for your answer."

   "cell_type": "markdown",

    "**Answer:** <br>\n",
    "In k-fold cross validation, the dataset is dividedd into k sets. Out of these k sets, one subset is chosen as a 'testing' set and other k-1 subsets are chosen as training sets. Therefore, we have k such combinations (each subset being the testing one time). We can perform training and testing operations 'k' times over these subsets and finally average the scores.\n",
    "Advantage: <br>\n",
    "1) There is no subset of dataset wasted. i.e all of the dataset is utilized fully rather than holding out the testing set completely in the conventional technique. <br>\n",
    "2) The subsetting ensures random sampling (when shuffle=True). Therefore, it gives more generalized results. <br>\n",
    "3) It prevents overfitting. i.e prevents the algorithm to memorize the training data. <br>\n",

    "### Implementation: Fitting a Model\n",
    "Your final implementation requires that you bring everything together and train a model using the **decision tree algorithm**. To ensure that you are producing an optimized model, you will train the model using the grid search technique to optimize the `'max_depth'` parameter for the decision tree. The `'max_depth'` parameter can be thought of as how many questions the decision tree algorithm is allowed to ask about the data before making a prediction. Decision trees are part of a class of algorithms called *supervised learning algorithms*.\n",
    "\n",
    "In addition, you will find your implementation is using `ShuffleSplit()` for an alternative form of cross-validation (see the `'cv_sets'` variable). While it is not the K-Fold cross-validation technique you describe in **Question 8**, this type of cross-validation technique is just as useful!. The `ShuffleSplit()` implementation below will create 10 (`'n_splits'`) shuffled sets, and for each shuffle, 20% (`'test_size'`) of the data will be used as the *validation set*. While you're working on your implementation, think about the contrasts and similarities it has to the K-fold cross-validation technique.\n",

    "For the `fit_model` function in the code cell below, you will need to implement the following:\n",
    "- Use [`DecisionTreeRegressor`](http://scikit-learn.org/stable/modules/generated/sklearn.tree.DecisionTreeRegressor.html) from `sklearn.tree` to create a decision tree regressor object.\n",
    "  - Assign this object to the `'regressor'` variable.\n",
    "- Create a dictionary for `'max_depth'` with the values from 1 to 10, and assign this to the `'params'` variable.\n",
    "- Use [`make_scorer`](http://scikit-learn.org/stable/modules/generated/sklearn.metrics.make_scorer.html) from `sklearn.metrics` to create a scoring function object.\n",
    "  - Pass the `performance_metric` function as a parameter to the object.\n",
    "  - Assign this scoring function to the `'scoring_fnc'` variable.\n",
